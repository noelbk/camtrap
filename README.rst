camtrap - catch jokers on video
===============================

Some people just can't resist the temptation to prank an unlocked
keyboard.  This locks your screen with a transparent window that will
play an alarm and snap a video if anyone touches it.  Quit by pressing
Control or Alt.


Installation
------------

Requires Python, PyQt4, and cv2.

I make a keyboard shortcut to locktrap_ which disables the current
screen saver, starts camtrap, then locks the screen when camtrap
exits.

.. _locktrap: locktrap
